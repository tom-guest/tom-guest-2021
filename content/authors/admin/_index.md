I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in [Felipe Cava's lab](https://www.thecavalab.com) at the Department of Molecular Biology, Umeå University, Sweden. 

I did my PhD at the University of Birmingham in the [Grainger Lab](https://www.graingerlab.com) studying gene transcription in the bacterial pathogen _Vibrio cholerae_.

I graduated from Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh in 2016 with a BSc in Biological Sciences.
