I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Alexander Westermann's [HOPI lab](https://www.helmholtz-hiri.de/en/research/organisation/teams/team/host-pathogen-microbiota-interactions/) in Würzburg, Germany. 

I did my PhD at the University of Birmingham in the [Grainger Lab](https://www.graingerlab.com) studying gene transcription in the bacterial pathogen _Vibrio cholerae_ and then a postdoc in Felipe Cava's group at Umeå University, Sweden. 

I graduated from Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh in 2016 with a BSc in Biological Sciences.
